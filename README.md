### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Sogexia
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently improving my skills on Angular and RxJS

### Bio

Keen on web development, i practice a lot of PHP over different frameworks like symfony or copix. Even if i also did some #dotNet, #java or #coldfusion, i liked workgin with #meteorjs (a so cool #nodejs platform for server-side Javascript). Front-end is also a new part of my job with #VueJS (v2... not started on v3) and #Angular (v2...15).

In 2014 i did a talk about meteor at #LyonJs organization (in french https://youtu.be/ncLUaIDmCDk?t=1045) , and since the #worldwidemeteorday i leaded a #meteorjs #meetup group in #Lyon for 3 years.

In 2015 i did a talk at the great #BlendWebMixconference in #Lyon with the following subject : Going faster with MeteorJS (in french https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6f7d_6VgiEM).

And in 2016 i did a talk on #VueJS at #BlendWebMixconference in #Lyon (in french https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-pt-7U2pNg).

I'm not a core contributor to open-source, but i try to help them when i can. You can find some of my contributions in symfony (code and docs), but also apiPlatform (mostly issues), clarity from VMWare ...:

* https://symfony.com/contributors/doc
* https://connect.symfony.com/profile/rebolon
* https://clarity.design/community

If you have a project, contact me, i'm sure i may help you.

Except my work, i'm keen on bicycle (road for speed and mountain bike for nature), and i really love my family and my 3 beautiful daughters.
